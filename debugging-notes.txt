If you configured the Kernel properly:

- In ~/.gdbinit put the line "add-auto-load-safe-path <path to kernel build>/scripts/gdb/vmlinux-gdb.py
- To attach GDB to the running kernel:
	> gdb <path to kernel build>/vmlinux
	(gdb) target remote : 1234
- Once you have GDB attached, running "lx-symbols" is super useful (need the vmlinux-gdb.py for this).
- I already have a 3 second delay after loading the module. This gives you time to do what you want w/ gdb.
- You can check where the module is being loaded in the dmesg output (I've set it to enable this logging automatically)
- CLGI is super important. I've put it into the VM_Setup_and_Run routine. This lets you step through the code w/out just hitting the fucking timer interrupts.
	- CLGI was also important for an atomic VMRUN anyway, I'm just stupid.
